# Description:
**Room-Booker-App** is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of managing room bookings within an organization. It offers a user-friendly interface that allows employees to securely log in, view, and manage their profile details alongside booking rooms for their needs. With features such as viewing available rooms, detailed room and booking information, and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for bookings, it facilitates seamless collaboration by enabling employees to invite others to meetings.
Deployed via Heroku, BookerApp aims to improve workplace efficiency and communication, with future plans for enhancements like developing a graphical display for room availability with timeslots and email notifications for booking changes.
